# PA_1.1

Actully, it's quite embarassing but I frankly should admit that this is my first project intended to explore git and github correctly.

At this time, I'm still unable to sync git in netbeans (the IDE I used to develop this small project) with github.
So, I uploaded the files manually. I really hope I can do syncronizing later.
